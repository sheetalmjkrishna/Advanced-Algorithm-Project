# Advanced-Algorithm-Project
Implemented a single pass space efficient streaming algorithm for triangle counting using the birthday paradox

README
======
1)To run the actual algorithm:
Run 'run.bat' in the 'Algorithm' folder to execute the code.

'birthday.py' contains the actual algorithm.
'w_Wedgestore.py' is a combination of wedge and edge reservoir.

In 'birthday.py', we have hard-coded the graph's file name and and reservoir sizes.

2)To run the baseline algorithm:
Open command prompt in the 'Baseline Algorithm' folder, and run:
python baseline.py
It'll ask you to enter a graph file's name, you can use any file or just use the sample facebook file present in the data folder 
(data/facebook_combined.txt)
